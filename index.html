      <h2>Debunking Transit Deserts</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      Areas without access to reliable transit are often called transit deserts. In New York, this usually correlates with subway access, as many consider neighborhoods without subway stations to be transit deserts. However, this common notion assumes that the subway is the only viable form of transit and ignores the extesnive bus and rail systems that serve the city.

    <p>
      This map examines three neighborhoods that are often referred to as transit deserts to take a closer look at the transit that's actually in these communities and also look at how far you can travel in 45 minutes on these non-subway transit routes. The map initially shows the subway network, but by clicking the buttons below, the rest of the transit network is revealed.
