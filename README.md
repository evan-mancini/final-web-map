Debunking Transit Deserts

This map examines Bayside, Maspeth, and Marine Park, three neighborhods that because they lack subway access, are often called "transit deserts." My goal with this map was to question the use of that "transit desert" term because it often assumes that only the subway is a viable transit option, ignoring all other transit modes. To show how far you can travel without the subway, I used 45-minute isochrones in each neighborhood, which are visible once you click into each neighborhood using the buttons in the map's sidebar. With more time, this map could also show 15- and 30- minute ischrones to portray a more in depth picture of the transit access provided by buses and commuter railroads.

The map initially shows the three neighborhoods in question as well as the subway routes. To use the map, click the bottons in the sidebar to fly to each neighborhood. This removes the subway route layer and adds local bus, express bus, Long Island Rail Road, and Metro-North Railroad routes. The 45-minute transit ischrones are also revealed after flyijng to a neighborhood. You can click the buttons to alternate neighborhoods or click the "return to citywide view" button to resume the map's load state.
